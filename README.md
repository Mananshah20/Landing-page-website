What is a landing page?
A landing page is the page a visitor arrives at on your website after clicking an ad . Inexperienced marketers often direct all of their PPC traffic to thier homepage, but this can be a big mistake. Specific landing pages tailored to different offers are essential for providing a quality experience for visitors and driving conversions with a targeted message that matches each user's need.
